Tutorial :

- Extract VSH Patcher + the Tools folder somewhere.
- Run a ftp server on ps3 (example multiman / rebug toolbox) and go here dev_flash/vsh/module/vsh.self
- Copy the vsh.self somewhere on your computer. (For any problems, take it via dev_blind/dev_rebug)
- Run the VSH Patcher, select your vsh.self in the application and click on the button 'Patch'
- If it's working a message will be displayed with the location of the new file called vsh.self, the vsh_patched.elf is the format non-crypted patched.
- Now you need to write into the flash dir but you can't, you need to mount it, with multiman (find an option to mount flash as dev_blind) or via rebug toolbox (dev_rebug) and you don't see these folders, on filezilla press F5 that refresh everything.
- Go here dev_blind/vsh/module/ (or dev_rebug/vsh/module/) and move the vsh.self patched by the program in the list, filezilla will ask you to replace it, select yes!
- Once replaced, restart your console, and connect on the PSN.
